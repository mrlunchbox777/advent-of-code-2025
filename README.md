# advent-of-code-2025

I'm doing with Advent of Code with agentic AI to see how well it can solve the problems, and documenting the process.

The puzzles are complete. This was an interesting exercise. Please see the READMEs in each day's folder for details on how the AI approached the problem, what prompts I used, and how well it did.
